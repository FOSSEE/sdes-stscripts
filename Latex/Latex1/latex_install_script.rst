TeX Live is an easy way to get up and running with the TeX document production system. It provides a comprehensive TeX system with binaries for most flavors of Unix, including GNU/Linux, and also Windows.

We may also install LaTeX using a package manager like 'Synaptic Package Manager in Ubuntu'.
Using 'Synaptic Package Manager': Open the 'Package Manager' > Search for 'texlive-full' > Mark for installation and apply.

We may use a Text editor (as per your choice) as LaTeX editor. However, we require a plug-in to do this.
We would like to illustrate the same using Gedit.
Install the plug-in: 'sudo apt-get install gedit-latex-plugin'.
To activate the plug-in: Click (Edit > Preferences > Plugins > Check LaTeX Plugin).
