8.5 Testing and debugging
=========================

1. Understand what is software testing
   * Definition (0.28 - 0.36)
   
#. Test simple functions for their functionality
   * Example using gcd function (0.37 - 2.19)
   * Use of __name__ == '__main__': (2.21 - 3.26)

#. Automate tests. 
   * Exercise 1: Write tests for gcd code (3.42 - 5.14)
   * Exercise 2: Write automated tests for LCM (5.21 - 5.54)

#. Understand the need for coding style 
   * What is the need for coding style (6.15 - 6.29)
   * Naming variables (6.36 - 7.24)  
   * Code style points (7.26 - 7.59)
   * Exercise 3: Give meaningful names to the variables in a code(8.04 - 8.21)

#. Handle Errors and Exceptions
   * Example of an error (8.28 - 9.21)
   * Use Exception in programs (9.21 - 11.22)
   * Understand the debugging process (10.33 - 11.52)
   * How to debug a program in python (11.56 - 13.19)
